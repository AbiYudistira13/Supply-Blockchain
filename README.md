# Supply-Blockchain

### Overview ###

The _Supply Blockchain_ Project is a feasibility study to explore how an industrial supply-chain can be implemented with blockchain technology. Particularly, we use an example from the automobile industry. 

The simulation begins with an automotive production line. The [Contribution guidelines for this project](https://github.com/Lebski/chain_pi) will be migrated to this project in a later development step. 

We also simulate the transportation and the selling of the car. 

This project uses the hyperledger fabric blockchain together with the hyperledger composer tool.
